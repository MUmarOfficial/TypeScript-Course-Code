## 📖 About

This repository is the companion codebase for my TypeScript learning series. Everything here is meant for practice, experiments, and deepening your TS muscle memory.

Whether you're just starting or leveling up, this repo should give you real code, not just theory.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- `TS/` — source TypeScript files, modules, lessons  
- `dist/` — compiled JavaScript output (build artifacts)  
- `JS/` — some JS files (if needed for reference)  
- `Practice Problems TS/` — extra challenges & exercises  
- `Problems/` — specific question sets  
- `tsconfig.json` — TS compiler config  
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — dependencies & scripts

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm (or yarn, whichever you prefer)
